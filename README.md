## Brief Summary
<div align="justify">
The following application presents the source code according to my Engineering Thesis, which had been my last 
examination on the Aviation Engineering curriculum. The following software has been built in the hybrid mode, which 
means the command line interface as well as this, the graphical user interface have been implemented. The software is
all-purpose tool. Moreover, it can be used to recognize and classify any kind of multiclass classification task.
</div>

## Technologies
<div align="justify">
The following technologies have been used in the project:
</div>

* Python 3.11;
* TensorFlow 2.6.0;
* Matplotlib 3.4.3;
* Tkinter 8.6;
* PIL 8.4.0;

## Functionality
<div align="justify"></div>

## Destination
<div align="justify">
The ultimate goal is to create the software that would be used during pre-flight inspections to detect any malfunctions
in the airframe. As well as this to pick up the pace of deep learning process to solve any multi-classification
problem.
</div>

## Inspirations
<div align="justify">
The following project is my own idea to test the application of artificial intelligence methods in the aviation
industry. Moreover, the following application introduce my self-taught learning process of the Python language
programming.
